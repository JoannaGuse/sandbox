## Getting Started

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

In the project directory, run `npm install` to install the dependencies e.g.:

```sh
cd questions
npm install
```

The exercise is divided into three parts. You'll find the instructions in `index.js`,
where you are expected implement solutions to the problems outlined.

Use the tests in `index.test.js` to validate your working. The idea is to get
all the tests passing.

## How to run the code / tests?

The tests can be run with:

```sh
npm test
```

or you can run the tests in 'watch' (continuous update mode) with:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```
